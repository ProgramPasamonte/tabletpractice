Description:
Crappy little things for practicing tablet drawing accuracy with.
I will probably come around and add more/better features later.

HOW TO USE THE DIFFERENT MODES
-+=<>=+-------------------------------------+=<>=+-

ACCURACY MODE

Draw a straight line from the green point to the red point. 
A new line is generated if you accurately draw it. 
Accuracy is shown at the top.

FEATURES:

Distance Options:

Checkboxes that allow lines of the listed length to appear.
You can check multiple for a random selection from each range.

Accuracy Threshold:

A slider that adjusts how accurate you need to be before a new line is generated.

Challenge mode (will probably remove later):

Disables the accuracy threshold. Each stroke will generate a new line. 
The score at the top will show your average accuracy across all the lines you made while challenge mode is toggled.

CONSECUTIVE LINE MODE

To begin:
Start the timer. 
You have 30s to draw as many accuracte lines as possible. 

Draw from the start point (green) to the end point (red).
A new line will start at the previous end point.

TODO

A mode where you sequentially draw from one point to another. When you reach the end point, another point spawns and you draw to that.
It will probably be a timed mode. Scored by a mix of accuracy and points hit. (Like an aim trainer).   BAREBONES IMPLEMENTED 

The line you draw will fade with either time or distance so it doesnt clog the screen. (will be good feedback on how steady the stroke was/is). WIP

Handwriting mode. A mode where you trace the outlines of fonts. Scored on accuracy.

Shape mode.

Maybe a lineart mode, where you can import images and trace them (probably not though cbf).
