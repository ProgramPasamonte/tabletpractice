Description:
Crappy little thing for practicing tablet drawing accuracy with. Courtesy mostly of ChatGPT.
I will probably come around and add more/better features later.

HOW TO USE: 

Play around with the toggles/checkboxes and some lines should appear.
I.e. Uncheck all the checkboxes and recheck the ones you want.
(yes its bugged at the beginning).

A random line of a randomised length will appear between two points. 

Draw a line between these coloured points, along the faint line. (Red to green or green to red, whatever you prefer, colours are just for differentiation).
It will show you how accurate you were at the top.

FEATURES:
Distance Options:

Checkboxes that allow lines of the listed length to appear.
You can check multiple for a random selection from each range.

Accuracy Threshold:

A slider that adjusts how accurate you need to be before a new line is generated.

Challenge mode:

Disables the accuracy threshold. Each stroke will generate a new line. 
The score at the top will show your average accuracy across all the lines you made while challenge mode is toggled.

TODO

A mode where you sequentially draw from one point to another. When you reach the end point, another point spawns and you draw to that.
It will probably be a timed mode. Scored by a mix of accuracy and points hit. (Like an aim trainer).

Handwriting mode. A mode where you trace the outlines of fonts. Scored on accuracy.

Shape mode.

Maybe a lineart mode, where you can import images and trace them (probably not though cbf).
