Description:
Crappy little thing for practicing drawing accuracy with. Courtesy mostly of ChatGPT.
I will probably come around and add more/better features later.

HOW TO USE: 

Play around with the toggles/checkboxes and some lines should appear. (yes its bugged at the beginning).
Draw a line between the coloured points, along the faint line. (Red to green or green to red, whatever you prefer, colours are just for differentiation).
It will show you how accurate you were at the top.

FEATURES:

Accuracy Threshold:

A slider that adjusts how accurate you need to be before a new line is generated.

Challenge mode:

Disables the accuracy threshold. Each stroke will generate a new line. 
The score at the top will show your average accuracy across all the lines you made while challenge mode is toggled.
